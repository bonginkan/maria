export class LazyServiceWrapper<T> {
  private instance?: T;
  private initPromise?: Promise<T>;
  private timeout: number;
  private retryAttempts: number;

  async getInstance(): Promise<T> {
    if (this.instance) return this.instance;
    if (this.initPromise) return this.initPromise;

    this.initPromise = this.initializeWithTimeout();
    return this.initPromise;
  }
}

// Enhanced service initializer with performance monitoring
export const createEnhancedAgentServices = async (
  options: EnhancedServiceOptions,
): Promise<LazyAgentServices> => {
  return {
    embeddingManager: new LazyEmbeddingManager(options.embedding),
    vectorStoreManager: new LazyVectorStoreManager(options.vectorStore),

    }
  }
}
```

    const entities = await this.entityExtractor.extract(code);
    const relationships = await this.relationshipManager.analyze(entities);
    return this.buildCodeGraph(entities, relationships);
  }
}

    if (cached) return cached;

    // Parallel execution with conflict resolution
    const result = await this.parallelExecutor.execute(request);
