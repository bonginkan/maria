## Issues and Findings

**Failed Modes**: thinking, analyzing, calculating, processing, evaluating, strategizing, synthesizing, brainstorming, designing, innovating, imagining, crafting, composing, debugging, researching, investigating, examining, diagnosing, auditing, organizing, architecting, modeling, planning, structuring, formatting, testing, validating, verifying, checking, reviewing, reflecting, pondering, considering, meditating, contemplating, optimizing, refining, perfecting, enhancing, polishing, learning, understanding, absorbing, discovering, exploring, collaborating, coordinating, facilitating, communicating, synchronizing

**Recommendations**:
- Improve mode detection accuracy
- Optimize context switching performance

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Consider caching for frequently used modes
- Optimize mode selection algorithm for better accuracy
- Implement lazy loading for mode display components
