## ðŸŽ“ Learning Paths

### For Computer Science Students

**Goal**: Learn algorithms and data structures interactively

```bash
maria
> /help                          # Overview of all commands
> /sort quicksort               # Learn quicksort algorithm
> /sort mergesort               # Learn merge sort
> /learn algorithms             # Complete CS curriculum
> /benchmark sorting            # Compare algorithm performance
> /algorithm complexity         # Big O notation tutorials
```

**Daily Practice** (15 minutes):

1. Start with one algorithm: `/sort [algorithm_name]`
2. Study the implementation details
3. Try performance analysis: `/benchmark [algorithm_name]`
4. Practice with code generation: `/code "implement [algorithm]"`

### For Software Developers

**Goal**: AI-powered development assistance and code quality

```bash
maria
> /model                        # Configure preferred AI model
> /code "function description"  # Generate code with AI
> /bug analyze                  # Bug detection and fixes
> /lint check                   # Code quality analysis
> /mode internal                # Experience 50 cognitive AI modes
```

**Development Workflow**:

1. Start MARIA: `maria`
2. Set preferred AI model: `/model`
3. Use for coding tasks: `/code`, `/bug`, `/lint`
4. Leverage AI modes for different tasks
5. Learn algorithms for better coding: `/sort`, `/learn`

### For Educators

**Goal**: Teach computer science with interactive tools

```bash
maria
> /learn algorithms             # Access full CS curriculum
> /sort quicksort --visualize   # Interactive algorithm demos
> /algorithm complexity         # Teach Big O notation
> /benchmark sorting            # Show performance differences
> /help                         # Command reference for lessons
```

**Classroom Integration**:

1. Install MARIA on classroom computers
2. Create lesson plans using algorithm commands
3. Use visualization features for demonstrations
4. Assign interactive algorithm practice
5. Show real-world performance comparisons
