### 2. 📊 **Active Reporting Integration**

Complete transparency with continuous progress reporting:

- **SOW Auto-Generation**: Automatic Statement of Work from natural language
- **Real-time Progress Dashboard**: Beautiful CLI visualizations
- **Proactive Problem Reporting**: Immediate alerts and recommendations
- **Performance Metrics**: Code quality, test coverage, execution speed

### 3. 🧠 **Self-Evolution Architecture**

MARIA learns and improves with every execution:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns from successful executions
- **Predictive Optimization**: Anticipates next steps
- **Error Recovery Learning**: Improves error handling over time
- **User Preference Adaptation**: Personalizes to coding style

### 4. ⚡ **Complete Professional Autonomy**

Execute complex projects with a single command:

```bash
maria code "Build a real-time chat application with user authentication"

# MARIA autonomously:
# 1. Generates project SOW
# 2. Creates file structure
# 3. Implements backend (Node.js/NestJS)
# 4. Builds frontend (React/TypeScript)
# 5. Writes tests (87% coverage)
# 6. Sets up Docker containers
# 7. Configures CI/CD pipeline
# 8. Deploys to cloud
```
