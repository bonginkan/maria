## 🔄 NEW: Active Reporting System (ホウレンソウ仕組み)

### ✨ Revolutionary Collaborative Intelligence

The Active Reporting System implements the proven Japanese business methodology **Horenso (報告・連絡・相談)** for AI development:

- **報告 (Hou - Report)**: Proactive progress reporting with intelligent triggers
- **連絡 (Ren - Contact)**: Real-time information sharing and status updates  
- **相談 (Sou - Consult)**: Collaborative decision-making and problem resolution

### 🧠 Intelligent SOW Generation

#### Automatic Project Planning from Natural Language

```bash
# Transform ideas into comprehensive project plans
maria report sow generate "Build a React dashboard with user authentication and analytics"

# Generated SOW includes:
✅ Detailed project breakdown (8 main tasks, 24 subtasks)
✅ Intelligent timeline (estimated 3.5 weeks)
✅ Risk assessment (3 identified risks with mitigation)
✅ Resource requirements (Frontend: 60%, Backend: 30%, DevOps: 10%)
✅ Quality gates (automated testing, security review, performance)
✅ Success criteria (measurable objectives)
```

#### Multi-Language SOW Generation

```bash
# Japanese
maria report sow generate "ユーザー認証システムを構築して、ダッシュボードとAPIを作成する"

# Chinese  
maria report sow generate "构建用户认证系统，创建仪表板和API"

# Korean
maria report sow generate "사용자 인증 시스템을 구축하고 대시보드와 API를 생성"

# Vietnamese
maria report sow generate "Xây dựng hệ thống xác thực người dùng, tạo dashboard và API"
```

### 📋 Advanced Task Management

#### Intelligent Task Decomposition

```bash
# Automatic task breakdown with smart dependencies
maria report task add "Implement user authentication system"

# AI automatically creates:
📋 Task 1: Design user database schema
    ├── Subtask: Define user model
    ├── Subtask: Create migration scripts
    └── Subtask: Set up database indexes

📋 Task 2: Implement JWT authentication (depends on Task 1)
    ├── Subtask: Setup JWT middleware
    ├── Subtask: Create login endpoint
    └── Subtask: Implement token refresh

📋 Task 3: Build user registration flow (depends on Task 1)
    ├── Subtask: Email validation service
    ├── Subtask: Password hashing
    └── Subtask: User verification
```
